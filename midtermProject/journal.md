Project name: NYUAD Puzzle Portrait

Preliminary description:
The game will be an image shuffle game fused with an image positioning canvas. The idea is to create a complete image of a campus space/object using bits of the entire image that the player collects in a image shuffle. The image shuffle will be an array of parts of the image that a player is trying to piece together as well as some unrelated image. When the user clicks the mouse on the image shuffle, they have the option to use the image that they land on to piece together the complete image or to reshuffle until they get the image puzzle piece that they need. 

The game will be multiplayer with the factor determining the winner being how quickly a player can piece together the image. To make things interesting, the player has an option to speed up the shuffle in hopes of getting to desired image puzzle piece faster inorder to beat the other player's time.
