Experimenting with noise.

The purpose of the project was to experimenet on the effect of noise on patterns. Noise is being introduced in the hovering cursor feature adding an additional moving fan. Noise is also being brought in through mousepressed feature that changes the image sections that make up the fans. 

An interesting and challenging part of  working on the assignment was getting to familiarize myself with the translate feature and the concet of reference points.
