## PROJECT GOAL AND DESCRIPTION

The goal of the project was to create a musical instrument that utilizes the varying thicknesses and hollowness of glass objects to produce different sounds. I took advantage of the different sounds made by plastic and metal whan hitting a glass to increase variety of sound. I ended up using a thin-walled, tall glass bottle to produce sounds of higher pitch and a thick-walled, short glass mug to produce sounds of lower pitch. On my breadboard, I connected two momentary switches and a light sensitive resistor. Different combinations of the buttons in conjunction with different levels of light brightness the resistor was exposed to produced varying speeds and orders of vibration of the motor that, inturn, produced different sounds when it hit the taller glass. I created a map for the glass objects because I noticed different distances between the glass objects and the motor(which hit the glass as it vibrated) produced varying loudness of the produced sounds. I also installed a lamp over the photosensitive resistor so the user could have more efficient control over the amount of light that would hit the resistor(the lamp is button controlled so the user can switch between bringth and dim light and consequently higher and lower vibrations by a push of a button). I decided to attach a metal chain to the motor in such a way that it would be the only thing striking the thick-walled glass mug because I noticed that the plastic motor stricking the thicker glass produced barely audible sound in comparison to the metal chain.

## DIFFICULTIES

The difficulty I faced was trying to get the buzzer and motor to work at the same time to be able to add musical variety to the project but I wasn't able to figure this out in time. However, I am still trying to figure it out!
