Experimenting with noise.

The purpose of the project was to experimenet on the effect of noise on patterns. Noise is being introduced in the hovering cursor feature adding an additional moving fan. Noise is also being brought in through mousepressed feature that changes the image sections that make up the fans. 

A challenging part of working on the assignment was getting to familiarize myself with the translate feature and the concept of reference points. An interesting part was figuring out the positions of each component of the spinning colors that would best create the illusion of order so as the emphasize the juxtaposition between order and chaos when the noise was introduced. It was extremely fun to make!
