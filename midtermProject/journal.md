Project name: NYUAD Puzzle Portrait

Preliminary description:
The game will be an image shuffle game fused with an image positioning canvas. The idea is to create a complete photo of a campus space/object using bits of the entire image that the player collects in a image shuffle. The image shuffle will be an array of parts of the image that a player is trying to piece together as well as some unrelated image. When the user clicks the mouse on the image shuffle, they have the option to use the image that they land on to piece together the complete photo or to reshuffle until they get the image puzzle piece that they need. 

The game will be multiplayer with the factor determining the winner being how quickly a player can piece together the photo. To make things interesting, the player has an option to speed up the shuffle in hopes of getting to desired image puzzle piece faster inorder to beat the other player's time.

The game will also have levels where as you progress on in levels the photos a player needs to piece together have more and more image tiles that make them up.

16th October
Objective: Collect necessary items.
Activity: Went out and took multiple pictures of campus that I plan to include in the game, Learnt how to use the shuffle feature inorder to shuffle image portions within the list, used photoshop to divide the photos I took into image segments.
Status: Completed
Ammendments to initial idea: None.

23rd October
Objective:Start on code, learn how to move between multiple pages, learn how to create buttons, instert images into code.
Activity: Studied Katie's code to figure out how to have multiple pages in the same code and how to create and use buttons in processing. Added all the mother photos into the code.
Status:Completed
Ammendments: None


26th October
Objective:Create image shuffle feature, figure out how to move the image pieces to complete puzzle, how to determine score and winner, add sound and encorporate svg file and rotate feature.
Activity: Created an array with image puzzle pieces and several random variables that would control random picking of image pieces from the array(shuffle). Studied Kyrie's code to determine how to move image piece from initial position to the position I wanted it to be. Could't get the images to drop into a specific spot so I changed the design and let the piece remain static instead. Created a counter for both players that incremented by 1 whenever code was ran and incrimented by a larger value whenever a mistake was made. The larger value increased as the level increased. Created a winners page by comparing both players'scores and the winner was chosen as the player with the least number on their counter. Found a retro themed soundtrack that plays throughout the duration of the game on loop. Added a rotating feature using an original csv file. The rotating feature happens on the start page as one image glides over another craeting a cool unveiling effect. learned about filters.

Status:Completed(somewhat)

Ammendments: I changed the activity of the game from it being a game where a player places pieces of a puzzle onto a canvas to a game where the user has to guess what picture and image was extracted from. The pictures are blurred and the player is now in a race against time to pick the right blurred image by inputing a corresponding number that the picture is labeled. The competetive element is still present since it is still designed for two players to play in the same level at different times and compare their times taken to complete level. 


Overall I have learned A LOT, most rewarding being how to work with arrays, filter and how to create a click button experience. Although it is not the outcome I initially had in mind, I am very proud of the hard work I put into it and the fact that any changes I did make weren't me avoiding a challenging aspect of my code(I struggled for hours on parts I couldn't figure out) but was me adjusting to the constraints of time and wanting to deliver what was required of me as per grading rubric. I will definitely keep trying on parts I couldn't figure out.



## NOTE FOR PROFESSOR SHILOH!

I would like to thank you, sincerely, for what you have done for me through this class so far. You have been patient, affirming and have succeeded in restoring my faith in my abilities and a potential future in code that I had lost when I attempted a Computer Scienec track. The creative control offered me in this class and the ability to move at my own pace while costantly being affirmeed that it is a valid pace specifically in this project has shown me that I am not incpable of coding functional projects, rather that I require a pace that suits me and a supportive environmnet to learn what I need to. I am very glad I joined IM and feel blessed to have had the opportunity to take this class with you. You are truly a blessing and excited for more classes with you!
