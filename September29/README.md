The concept of the game/artwork was to create a unique spin on a typically multiplayer game to show how the conceptt of multiplayer necessity in interractive games is a matter of perspective. To accomplish this I increased the proportions of the game to hide the second paddle and so only one player could play it and the game transforms from a multiplayer dynamic to being based on luck.
