When Love Arrives

The inspiration for this project is my favourite poem by Sarah Kay tited When Love Arrives. I wanted to capture the imagery that goes through my head and the tone that is set when I hear very specific words in the poem. Because I failed to use a text csv file, I created a rubric for converting very specific words to numbers which was as follows: Sarah-1, Phil-2, I-3, my-4, love-7. After this, I cleaned up any exces wording from the poem and converted the word file to a numeric csv file that I proceeded to work with in my code. The most challenging part was building the shapes for the words as they appeared in my head and failing to learn how to work with a text csv file. The data visualization element of the project is based on the logic of frequency of object appearence corresponding to frequency of the word used and at what time during the poem.
