### PROCESS

The process became simple after revisiting the lecture and understanding exactly what DigitalReadSerial did since I didn't quite understand it in class. After that the execution of the puzzle was based on random decisions. I decided to make the objective of the game turning all the lights off at the same time and decided, randomly, to assign what combination of buttons would accomplish that.
